        <p>შენ ხარ ვენახი, ახლად აყვავებული,<br>
            ნორჩი კეთილი, ედემს შინა ნერგული,<br>
            ალვა სუნელი, სამოთხეს ამოსული,<br>
            ღმერთმან შეგამკო ვერვინა გჯობს ქებული,<br>
            და თავით თვისით მზე ხარ და გაბრწყინვებული.</p>

        <p>You are a vineyard newly blossomed.<br>
            Young, beautiful, growing in Eden,<br>
            A fragrant poplar sapling in Paradise.<br>

            You yourself are the sun, shining brilliantly.</p>

        <h2>Information</h2>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Kakhetian version of this chant has gone through a number of transformations throughout its history. Vasil Karbelashvili transcribed this chant in Eastern Georgia at the turn of the 20th century, yet his chant transcriptions were locked up and inaccessible during the Soviet period.[insert citation footnote: Graham] The composer Zakaria Paliashvili, influenced by the Russian school of composition, arranged the Kakhetian version for six voices (SATTBB) at around the same time. Unlike Karbelashvili's transcription, Paliashvili's arrangement was available during the Soviet period. As such, it seems to have served as the basis for the Rustavi Ensemble's own arrangement, which originated in the 1960s and was once again reduced to three voices (from Paliashvili's six).[insert citation footnote: Graham]</p>
        <p>The Rustavi Ensemble arrangement is perhaps the most well-known chant in mainstream society today; it is associated with weddings, celebrations, and important moments in Georgian history. For example, it was performed by the Basiani Ensemble in August, 2008, during the war between Russia and Georgia.[insert citation footnote: Graham]</p>
