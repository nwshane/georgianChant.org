    Website Objective

GeorgianChant.org is dedicated to the gathering and dissemination of accurate information about Georgian Orthodox chant, the traditional religious music of the Republic of Georgia. The site contains all aspects of knowledge related to Georgian chant, including recordings, history, sheet music, chant texts, polyphony and counterpoint, educational materials and more.

The longterm goal of GeorgianChant.org is to become a central resource for basic knowledge about all Georgian chants, and to provide an introduction to Georgian chant for those who are new to the music. For deeper analysis and history of this complex and beautiful tradition, see the many resources in our references section.

GeorgianChant.org is an ongoing project: We will continue to add new content to the site on a regular basis. If you are knowledgeable about Georgian chant and would like to contribute, please contact us at [insert email here].
